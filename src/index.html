  <h2>A brief history of Late King Prithivi Narayan Shah</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>A king by luck
      <p>As the eldest son of King Nara Bhupal Shah, Prithvi Narayan Shah was the crown prince and heir to the throne of Gorkha. But, it is believed that Brinda Keshar Shah, the son of King Nara Bhupal Shah and another queen Buddhimati, got on the womb first. But, Prithvi Narayan Shah was born earlier in the seventh month of his mother’s pregnancy.
      This created a huge discussion among the people regarding the selection of the crown prince of the state. The final decision was at King Nara Bhupal Shah’s discretion. As the decision was yet to be made, Brinda Keshar Shah died when he was around seven years old. And, Prithvi Narayan Shah became the sole heir to the throne.

    <li>Two wives
      <p>Shah was married to Indra Kumari Devi, the daughter of the king of Makawanpur, Hemkarna Sen, at the age of 14 in 1738. But, due to some issues, he married Narendra Rajya Laxmi Devi, the daughter of Abhiman Singh, a Rajput chief of Banaras in 1740.

    <li>A link with Guru Gorakhnath
      <p>There is a popular legend about a link between King Prithvi Narayan Shah and Guru Gorakhnath, a god-like figure. As per the legend, child Shah once came across Guru Gorakhnath in the forest near his cave. The holy man asked him to bring some curd. Shah then ran to his palace and narrated everything to his mother. His mother handed over the curd to Shah and told him to follow what the holy man said.
      Accordingly, Shah went to the same place where he met the holy man. Guru Gorakhnath put the curd brought by Shah and regurgitated it in his hand and asked him to drink it.

      After the demise of his father, Prithvi Narayan Shah ascended the throne of Gorkha at the age of 20 on April 3, 1743. Before he started the unification campaign, Nepal was scattered into many small kingdoms categorised into groups of 22 and 24 states. Besides, the Kathmandu valley (Kantipur, Patan and Bhadgaon) was ruled by three Malla kings. Those principalities were disunited and involved in internal rivalry and frequent battles.
